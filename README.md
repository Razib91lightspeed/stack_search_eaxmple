# stack_search_eaxmple
In this example, we define a Stack class with push, pop, isEmpty, and search member functions. 
The search function uses a loop to search for a particular value x in the stack. 
In main, we create a Stack objects, push some values onto the stack, and then prompt the user to enter a value to search for. 
We call the $search function on s to determine if the value is in the stack, and output the result.
